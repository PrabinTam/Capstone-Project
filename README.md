# Capstone-Project
This is a project I am doing for capstone project.
First, I will mention that this is still ongoing project hence the files I have commited will undergo changes. 

Now, what does this project do?
    This project is writing code in python, which will act as a mini-antivirus
How is it a Mini-antivirus:
    The first of the project was to get all the process running on the Windows OS and check if it is malicious or not by taking the hash of the process
    and running it against virus total, using its API to determine if it is malicious.
    
    The Second part of the script will run in the system continously and detect if any file is added on the system. Once it detects, it will check if it
    is malicious or not using the same process.
    
    The third part of the script is going to go through all the files inlcuding the new ones that gets added, and checks if it contains personal informion such as
    Credit Card number and SSN.
